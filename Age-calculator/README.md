# AgeCalculator

This project is a simple Age Calculator application created as part of an internship at CodeAlpha. It is built using Angular, providing basic arithmetic operations in a clean and intuitive interface.

## Overview

Users should be able to:

* View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
  * Receive validation errors if:
  * Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  * The day number is not between 1-31
  * The month number is not between 1-12
  * The year is in the future
  * The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
* View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
* See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
* Bonus: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted
